DREAMER
Roleplaying IRC bot

for single server/channel use

Requirements:
Python (2.6)
Python-irclib

Dice rolling:
d2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100

Modifiers: +/-

OpenXtY die rolls: If any die shows its maximum value, roll another die and add its result to the total.
ObXtY: If any die shows its maximum value, replace it with two new dice.


To fix:
 - Proper README
 - !roll: count number of results (for successes)
 - !roll: special games-rolls (WoD, Gurps, d20?)
 - !gmon, !gmoff: Add password-based security
 - External XML file for config
 - Logging
 - Support for multiple languages (!speak [language] - command)
